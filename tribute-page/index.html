                    Here's a time line of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's life:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1876</strong> - Born in Karachi, Sindh</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1895</strong> - At age 19, he became the
                        youngest British Indian to be called to the bar in
                        England. Jinnah studied at Bombay University and at
                        Lincoln's Inn in London.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1913</strong> - Jinnah left Indian National
                        Congress and joined All India Muslim League
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1916</strong> - He was elected as the president
                        of All India Muslim League
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1920</strong> - The Indian National Congress
                        launched a movement of non-cooperation to boycott all
                        aspects of British rule. Jinnah opposed this policy and
                        resigned from the congress. There were by now profound
                        differences between the congress and the Muslim League.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1940</strong> - At a Muslim League session in
                        Lahore, the first official demand was made for the
                        partition of India and the creation of a Muslim state of
                        Pakistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1947</strong> - His insistence on this issue
                        through negotiations with the British government
                        resulted in the partition of India and the formation of
                        the state of Pakistan on 14 August 1947.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1947</strong> - Jinnah became the first governor
                        general of Pakistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1948</strong> - Jinnah died of tuberculosis on
                        11 September 1948.

                        history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly
                        anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state.
                        Muhammad Ali Jinnah did all three"
